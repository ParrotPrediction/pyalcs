Anticipatory Learning Classifiers in Python - PyALCS
====================================================

Anticipatory Learning Classifier Systems (ALCS)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ALCS are is an extension to basic LCS compromising the notation of anticipations. Doing that the systems predominantly are able to **anticipate perceptual consequences of actions** independent of a reinforcement predictions.

ALCS are able to form complete anticipatory representation (build environment model) which allows faster and  intelligent adaptation of behaviour or problem classification.
