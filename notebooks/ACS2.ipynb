    "### ACS  (1997)\n",
    "First ALCS ([ACS](http://www.psychologie.uni-wuerzburg.de/stolzmann/gp-98.ps.gz)) was developed by Stolzman in 1997 (with puts an additional anticipatory part in each classifier). It is a new kind of classifier system that learn by using the cognitive mechanism of anticipatory behavioral control (introduced in cognitive psychology by Hoffman).\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### Anticipatory Behavioral Control\n",
    "In 1992 Hoffman formulated a learning mechanism with basic assumption that a decisive factor for purposive behavior is the anticipation of the behavior consequences. Behavior consequences usually depend on the situation in which the behavior is executed. So it is necessary to learn in which situation `S` which behavior `R` (reaction) leads to which effects `E`.\n",

    "### Anticipatory Learning Process (ALP)\n",
    "The ALP was originally derived from the cognitive theory of anticipatory behavioral control (Hoffman, 1993).\n",
    "\n",
    "It compares the anticipation of each classifier in an action set with the real next situation $\\sigma(t+1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process results in the evaluation and specialization of the anticipatory model in ACS2.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ALP first update classifier parameters. Next an offspring is generated and inaccuate classifiers are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The quality $q$ of a generated classifier is set to the parent's value but never lower than 0.5 since the new classifier is supposedly better than the parental classifier. The reward prediction $r$ inherits the value of its parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution of an action is accompanied by the formation of the action set, which represents the anticipations of the real next situation. Thus, ACS2 satisfies the first point of Hoffmann's theory of anticipatory behavioral control which states that *any behavioral act or response (R) is accompanied with an anticipation of its effects*. Moreover, *the comparison of the anticipation of each classifier in [A] can be compared to a continuous comparison of anticipations with real next situations* as stated in Hoffmann's second point. The third and fourth point address the consequences of the comparison and are realized in the distinction of an unexpected case and an expected case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameter updates\n",
    "The following parameters are updated in the **following order** - quality ($q$), mark ($M$), application average ($aav$), ALP timestamp ($t_{alp}$) and the experience counter ($exp$).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Quality\n",
    "The quality $q$ is updated according to the classifiers anticipation. If the classifier predicted correctly, the quality is increased using the following (Widrow-Hoff delta rule) formula:\n",
    "$$q \\leftarrow q + \\beta (1- q)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise it is decreased:\n",
    "$$q \\leftarrow q - \\beta q$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the equation, $\\beta \\in [0,1]$ denotes the **learning rate** of ACS2. The smaller the learning rate, the more passive ACS2 updates its values and the less are the values biased towards recent environmental interactions. On the other hand, the larger the learning rate, the faster the parameters adapt to changes in the environment but also the more noisy are the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mark\n",
    "Situation $\\sigma(t) = (\\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_L)$ is added to the mark $M = (m_i, \\dots, m_L)$ if the classifier did not anticipate correctly. In this case $\\forall_i m_i = m_i \\cup \\{ \\sigma_i\\} $.\n",

    "The ALP generates specialized offspring and/or deletes *inaccurate* classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Inaccurate classifiers are classifiers whose quality is lower than the inaccuracy threshold $\\theta_i$. When the quality of a classifiers falls below $\\theta_i$ after an update, it is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specialized classifiers are generated in two ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An **expected case**, in which a classifier anticipated the correct outcome, a classifier *might* be generated if the mark $M$ differs from the situation $\\sigma(t)$ in some attributes, i.e. $\\exists_{i,j} l_j \\in m_i \\wedge l_j \\neq \\sigma_i$. Since the mark specifies the characteristics of situations in which a classifier did not work correctly, a **difference indicates that the specific position might be important to distinguish the correct and wrong outcome case**. Thus, the ALP generates an offspring whose conditions are further specialized. If there are unique differences in the mark compared to the current situation, i.e. $\\exists_i \\sigma_i \\notin m_i$, then one of the unique difference is specialized in the offspring. However, if there are only positions that differ but $\\sigma_i$ is always part of $m_i$, i.e. $\\forall_i \\sigma_i \\in m_i$, then all differing positions are specialized.\n",
    "> The number of specialized positions in the conditions that are not specialized in the effects is limited to $u_{max}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In other words:\n",
    "  - the strength of the classifier is increased,\n",
    "  - if there is a mark, then a new classifier is formed that is more specific in the `C` and `E` parts, trying to exclude the possibility to be chosen in the state(s) described by mark\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In an **unexpected case**, a classifier did not anticipate the correct outcome (one or more predicted changes are incorrect or when one or more components change that were predicted to stay the same).\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this case a classifier:\n",
    "  - is marked by the situation $\\sigma(t)$,\n",
    "  - has decreased quality: $cl.q \\leftarrow cl.q - \\beta \\cdot cl.q$\n",
    "\n",
    "  In difference with the ACS all classifiers from the action set will become marked in this case.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Also, an offspring classifier may be generated, if the effect part of the old classifier can be further specialized (by changing pass-through symbols to specific values) to specify the perceived outcome correctly. All positions in condition and effect part are specialized that change from $\\sigma(t)$ to $\\sigma(t+1)$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Therefore attributes whose value changed in the environment but are anticipated to stay the same are specified in condition and effect part of the offspring.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In other words:\n",
    "  - the classifier gets a mark,\n",

    "> #### Interaction of ALP and GG.\n",
    "Several distinct studies in various environments revealed that the interaction of ALP and GG is able to evolve a complete, accurate, and maximally general model in various environments in a competent way (see e.g. Butz, Goldberg, and Stolzmann, 2000, Butz, 2001). The basic idea behind the interacting model learning processes is that the specialization process extracts as much information as possible from the encountered environment continuously specializing over-general classifiers. The GG mechanism, on the other hand, randomly generalizes exploiting the power of a genetic algorithm where no more additional information is available from the environment. The ALP ensures diversity and prevents the loss of information of a particular niche in the environment. Only GG generates identical classifiers and causes convergence in the population."
