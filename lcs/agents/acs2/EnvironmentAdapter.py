class EnvironmentAdapter:
    """
    Sometimes the observation returned by the OpenAI Gym environment
    does not suit the observation representation as used by the LCS.
    In that case there's a need for converter functions that map the LCS
    representation to the environment representation and vice versa.

    The same goes for action representation.

    This class realizes this conversion.

    This implementation works for environments which provide LCS-compatible
    state and action representations (no conversion needed).

    Subclass this class in pyALCS integration to provide an adapter
    for a specific environment.
